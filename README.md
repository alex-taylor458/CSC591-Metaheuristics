# CSC591-Metaheuristics

This project was made with the purpose of converting a known algorithm into Julia and then using it to solve the TSP problem. Then the algorithm will be used to generate TSP art.
Attached to this repository is the art and the presentation deck that was given. The project report is attached to the Jupyter Notebook file.
The Jupyter Notebook file is unfortunately too large to upload but can be viewed along with the project report at the Google Colab link below. Make sure to click open with Colaboratory.
